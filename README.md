# HR Talent Lens â€” Full Prototype\n\nRun: pip install -r requirements.txt && streamlit run app.py

Sample Prompts:

We need a high-stake project leader in Toronto with strong cloud architecture and AI/ML experience, available in the next 2 weeks, with a budget around 150k CAD. Show the top 5 best-fit employees


Find me a mid-level developer who has worked on IoT projects and also knows DevOps practices, located near Calgary, with strong performance reviews.

Recommend employees who can work on a customer-facing banking project with cybersecurity and compliance expertise, but ensure their expected budget is under 100k CAD

I need an AI engineer who is currently busy, but will be available in the next quarter for a strategic data platform migration project.

Show me employees who are not only skilled in Python and Spark, but also have proven mentoring or leadership experience for managing a team of interns.

Who are the top candidates for a DevOps automation role if the project is based in Calgary, but can also consider remote employees within Canada?
